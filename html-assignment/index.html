        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello Professor! My name is Esther Oluwatomisona Odeyemi, I am in your MTM6130_020 Web Development class, which meets on Thursdays, at 8:00 am, in room T229. I am from Ogun State in <em>Nigeria</em>. This is my 3<sup>rd</sup> time attending your class and I am really enjoying it.
        I chose the Interactive Media Design program here in Algonquin College because it is a combination of my hobbies/interests. I am excited to have an in-depth knowledge and practical experience of this program.
        </p>
        <p>I have previously studied Information and Communication Engineering back home in Nigeria so i have some basic knowledge on some courses. This is a whole new experience for me in terms of the diverse cultures and I am enjoying my learning here at <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr>. My stay in Canada has been peaceful and I am excited to know more about this beautiful country.
        </p>
        <p>Here is my favorite quote...
